description: XR-PaestumGate explores the potential of immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) in the field of cultural heritage enhancement. The project extends the virtual reconstruction of the archaeological site of Paestum by designing and implementing a Serious Game in VR integrating game mechanics designed to increase user engagement and interest. The development integrated 3D modelling tools, the Unity game engine and XR technologies to create an immersive serious game. The experience consists of various activities, from exploring the environment to discover key locations to driving a Roman chariot. The Serious Game was developed in two versions: Desktop and VR. The entire experience was tested by various users in the two versions to investigate how perception changes according to the medium. The questionnaire at the end of the test is based on different rating scales: GUESS, EgameFlow, SUS, evaluating the experiential impact on engagement, learning and perception of the cultural value of the Paestum site. The results show that XR-PaestumGate not only amplifies engagement but also creates an emotional connection to the past. This study represents a step forward in the connection between technology and cultural heritage, underlining the important role of XR in the promotion and protection of cultural heritage.
